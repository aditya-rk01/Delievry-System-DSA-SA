# Delievry-System-DSA-SA

We aim to develop a system that helps a shop to manage its delivery system. The customer is presented with a list of items that can be ordered. The customer selects the order and some basic information of the customer including his/her location is taken. Based on the inputs, the system will suggest which delivery boy has to do the pickup from the store and use the shortest path to deliver.
